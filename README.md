# Website

This website was built for the fourth project required for the Founders and Coders Skills Bootcamp programme.
It contains four sections:

## 1 `About`
In the About me section I describe what is my current occupation. I use flex containers that are collapsed by default, so they can have a look to the whole website easier.
Cliking on the tabs the containers will show the whole content.

## 2 `Why move to a web developer career`
For this section I used the same elements as before.

## 3 `What I learned so far` 
In this section I wanted to replicate the aesthetics of the previous sections but using grids instead flex containers. I wanted to include everything in one single "card" to showcase the different distribution of the images and text along the different rows.
Here you will find links to the previous workshops, both the code and the deployments.

## 4 `A peek to the future` 
I wanted to add the last project of the application to this website, it is a great way to see in one glance my evolution in these weeks while preparing my aplication.


Regarding the JavaScript part of this project we just need to add to each `h2.collapsible`, an event listener that adds or removes the class `collapsed`.
