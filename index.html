                    <h2>Vigo</h2>
                    <p>In this picturesque seaside city, I spent the first 18 years of my life. It was here where, at the tender age of 12, I attended my inaugural coding classes alongside my brother. It was a transformative experience. I was immediately smitten, my perception forever changed. I finally understood that machines were not impenetrable boxes of mystery, but entities I could converse with.<br> Simultaneously, I was also engrossed in studying music, specifically piano and singing. All these disparate elements would later interweave significantly, shaping my future in ways I could hardly have anticipated.</p>

                    <h2>San Sebastián</h2>
                    <p>In San Sebastián, I earned my credentials as an IT engineer. Concurrently, I nurtured my passion for music, delivering hundreds of concerts and participating in several operas with the Easo Abesbatza ensemble. I maintained my vocal training and also delved into the study of dubbing. The experience was so enriching that I was swiftly recruited by the same academy to impart vocal techniques to aspiring singers and TV presenters. It was during this period that I embarked on the construction of my recording studio and discovered my love for sound engineering.</p>

                    <p>My initial stay in London was incredible, marking my first experience in a foreign country. I had the opportunity to engage with several recording studios, which ignited my passion for sound engineering. My prior experience in IT was less than thrilling, so I gradually, and without a concrete plan, began transitioning from IT to sound engineering and voice acting.</p>

                    <h2>Amsterdam</h2>
                    <p>I fondly recall my time in Amsterdam. Although it was a brief period, just under two years, I enjoyed a tranquil and intellectually enriching life there. I worked for IDFA, a documentary festival, which provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the entire media production process. Concurrently, my studio continued to improve, as did my sound engineering skills.</p>

                    <p>I spent just under a year traveling through Australia. During this time, I didn't engage in IT or sound engineering work, but instead took on temporary jobs here and there. This journey significantly broadened my perspective, a process that began in Amsterdam and reached its peak in Australia. The trip greatly enhanced my understanding of myself and others. It taught me to value friendships that have a finite lifespan and to appreciate the simplicity of life.</p>

                    <h2>London</h2>
                    <p>Returning to London, I was acutely aware that there was much more to explore in this city. With the right energy, things can progress rapidly. In London, my voice acting career solidified, and I honed my sound engineering skills. My expertise grew to the point where I was hired solely to oversee the setups of other sound engineers. Now, at the midpoint of my life, I feel less compelled to discover new things and more driven to apply what I've learned. I believe that magic happens at the intersections of knowledge fields, or when you merge technologies that weren't initially designed to work together, like origami and sewing. To provide a platform for my skills to interact and grow, I need to return to my roots, the place where all my interests converge: software development.</p>

                            <article><p>As an IT professional, I worked as a project manager in software development companies for 7 years. However, I didn't get to develop my technical skills due to my PM role, and ended up doing sales tasks.</p>
                                <p>It was not at all what I wanted, so I decided to take a chance and switch careers, focusing on sound engineering and voiceover work. During these years, I have continued to program, but only for personal and small projects, such as everything related to 3D printing, my CRM, or Arduino projects.</p>
                                <p>For these reasons, I would like to return to programming, and although I do not rule out PM tasks, I would love to develop my more technical skills.</p></article>
