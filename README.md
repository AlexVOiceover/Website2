#  My Personal Journey - A Website
This website reflects a different approach to presenting myself. Rather than simply listing out biographies or coding experiences, I wished to delve deeper and share what truly defines me - through the lens of my personal choices and experiences.

The places where we choose to live and the hobbies we adopt often speak volumes about our personality. Keeping this in mind, I've dedicated this website to artfully blend and share a visual walkthrough of the various places I've lived, alongside a curated selection of my pastimes.

While I have indulged in numerous coding-related hobbies like home assistant projects, drone building, and 3D printer construction, I've chosen to keep those separate. I firmly believe in the power of interpersonal communication and would prefer to elaborate on these areas directly - in our future meetings and discussions.

The website was envisioned to be simple and uncluttered, with a strong emphasis on images and a few thoughtfully chosen words. However, along the design journey, a hint of JavaScript found its way in, subtly enhancing the overall visitor experience.

To showcase some of my technical skills, I also crafted an engaging game, which you can explore here: https://alexvoiceover.github.io/Game3/index.html

## Building The Site
Symbolic and impactful, photos lie at the heart of this website. They sketch out the different countries where I've lived, infusing a personal touch and a storytelling approach to the narrative.

To add a dash of dynamism and interactivity, I've incorporated one of the most common yet effective elements - an Image Carousel. The carousel, together with a tastefully designed divider, greatly styles up the visual aesthetics and user engagement on the site.

I invite you to embark on this short, personal trip through my life, hoping it provides a thorough understanding of the individual behind the student.
