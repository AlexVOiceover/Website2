I didn't want to use a direct approach, biography and some of my coding jobs, but something that I think that defines better the person behind the student.
A person can be defined by their choices, and what more personal choices than the place where you decide to life and your hobbies. I just wanted to recreate a short trip about some of the places I lived, and a small selection of my hobbies.
I tried to leave out those one more related with coding, like some home assistant projects, drone building, 3d printers building, etc. I think that all that part is better explained face to face in the meetings that we had and those that will come.
I also wanted something extremely simple, I tried to not use Javascript at all to focus the attention on the pictures and a few paragraphs, but at the end I had to add a bit of JS code. I think that the place to show off some technical skills is the game. You can find mine here:

## 1 `How was built`
I really wanted to use photos to ilustrate the different countries where I lived. After that I wanted to spice it up with some animations and at the end I just built one of the most common elementes out there: An Image carrousel".
To style it a bit more I just added a fancy divider.
